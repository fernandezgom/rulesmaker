The technical innovation of iRules project lies behind on the fact that it will be a platform responsible of bringing together exploratory content to facilitate learning mathematics to the students and an intuitive interface to facilitate making rules to the teachers, which want to add extra support to the exploratory content. The importance of creating an interface to make rules from the scratch will help teachers that they donâ€™t have programming skills or technological background to improve the system intelligence and student experience.

The making rules interface will be properly designed considering a good interaction design to facilitate the teacher labour as much as possible. All this, will result on helping the student to navigate through the exploratory content with all support that the teacher has decided to apply by means of rules. To reduce on a sentence: more learning for students and simplicity of making support for the teachers.
